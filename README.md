## Sprint 1
1. Krrish Chawla
What I did: Built Front End + Back End, OpenAI Integration, Prompting
What I aim to do for next sprint: Work on better matching models and data masking or encryption, more front/backend

2. Arvind Saligrama
What I did: Researched embedding models and decided to use INSTRUCTOR embeddings. Created prompts for INSTRUCTOR model and implemented similarity matching algorithm for app.
What I aim to do for next sprint: Try and improve mathcing/embedding models. Work on more backend. User interviews for features to add.

3. Roy Yuan
What I did: did brute force method for matching, collected resumes, prompting, brainstorm encryption and algorithm
What I aim to do for next sprint: Integrate better brute force method with app, more backend, work on encryption
