Team Member's Contributions
## Sprint 1
1. Krrish Chawla
What I did: Built Front End + Back End, OpenAI Integration, Prompting
What I aim to do for next sprint: Work on better matching models and data masking or encryption, more front/backend

2. Arvind Saligrama
What I did: Researched embedding models and decided to use INSTRUCTOR embeddings. Created prompts for INSTRUCTOR model and implemented similarity matching algorithm for app.
What I aim to do for next sprint: Try and improve matching/embedding models. Work on more backend. User interviews for features to add.

3. Roy Yuan
What I did: did brute force method for matching, collected resumes, prompting, brainstorm encryption and algorithm
What I aim to do for next sprint: Integrate better brute force method with app, more backend, work on encryption


## Sprint 2
1. Krrish Chawla
What I did: Experimented with different algorithms for matching, built more frontend, created a few data masking pipelines and finalized on the one that uses LLMs.
What I aim to do for next sprint: Incorporate data masking, finalize on matching algorithm, make back-end more efficient, more front end (we aim to include a button to generate matches on demand)

2. Arvind Saligrama
What I did: Wrote algorithm that updates best employee for each project whenever you upload a new employee. Integrated brute force algorithm with current embeddindgs algorithm. Did a user interview
What I aim to do for next sprint: Work on getting better embeddings. Specifically, a chunking algorithm that assigns weights to different experiences on the resume.

3. Roy Yuan
What I did: finished brute force algorithm for employee matching for each project whenever you upload a new employee, integrated the brute force algorithm with the existing frontend, did a few user interviews, scraped (legally) additional resumes to test our product on
What I aim to do for next sprint: help teammates with whatever they need, work on encryption, finalize algorithm for employee matching

## Sprint 3
1. Krrish Chawla
What I did: Incorporated data masking with the app, strategized on resume chunking, did error handling in the app, front end (LLM reasoning on dashboard), code clean.
What I aim to do for next sprint: Further test data masking, work on LLM prompt optimization with DSPy to get best results, more error handling - making the app industry scalable.

What I did: 
What I aim to do for next sprint: 

3. Roy Yuan
What I did: Incorporated handling for reasoning in project description, strategized for best employee selection, did handling for updating all projects if when new employee added is the best employee (for a project)
What I aim to do for next sprint: Help with faster model, help with encrypt, anything LLM related, clean up any final pieces so project is presentable
